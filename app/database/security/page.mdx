# Database Security

At Incerto, we take database security seriously. Our design ensures that your data stays in your control.

- **Local-First Processing**  
  All database interactions happen entirely on your local machine. The only external calls are to LLM APIs for AI-powered suggestions.

- **No Data Storage**  
  We do not store, log, or transmit your database contents, queries, or results to any external servers.

- **Minimal External Communication**  
  Apart from necessary API calls to the LLM provider, no other outbound data transfers occur.

- **Your Infrastructure, Your Rules**  
  We run within your environment — whether that's your local system, a VM, or an internal server — so you remain in control of access and network visibility.

- **Transparent Execution**  
  AI may suggest queries or actions, but execution only happens when you explicitly approve it. You decide what runs and when.

- **Database Permissions Respected**  
  All actions follow your existing database permissions, so AI suggestions cannot bypass security roles or privileges.

- **No Background Sync**  
  There are no hidden uploads, telemetry, or background syncing of your database information.

## Summary

Incerto is built to work like a secure, local AI assistant — bringing the power of AI to your databases without compromising control, privacy, or compliance.
