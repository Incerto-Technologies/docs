## Introduction

Incerto is your AI-native database copilot that understands your database and helps you do database specific tasks faster using natural language, with the help of multiple AI agents.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1 : Download and Install

1. Go to [incerto.in](https://incerto.in) and click the **Download** button. The supported OS are:
   - **Windows:** `.exe` installer
   - **macOS (Apple Silicon):** `.dmg` file
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Incerto requires Docker to be up and running. Please follow [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) to install Docker.
4. Launch Incerto after installation.

### Step 2 : Add Your Database

1. Open Incerto and navigate to **Add a Connection**.
2. Fill in the details below:
   - `Name`: A custom label for this connection (for easy identification later).
   - `Host`: The database server address - can be an IP or a domain name.
   - `Port`: The port your database service is listening on (e.g., 5432 for PostgreSQL, 3306 for MySQL).
   - `User`: The username used to connect to the database.
   - `Password`: The password for the above user.
3. Click **Test and Save** to ensure everything works and save it.

### Step 3 : Talk to the Agents

1. In the Incerto interface, go to the **Ask AI Anything** panel on the right side.
2. Type a natural language request. Something like:
   - *List the top 10 queries by execution time*
   - *Show me the total sales by month for the last year*  
   - *Find all users who signed up in the past 7 days*
3. Incerto automatically generates and runs the SQL, showing you the results.
